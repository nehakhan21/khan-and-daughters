    <p class="font-weight-light text-center">Rice is not only a staple item for many people around the world, but a way of life for the Khan Family. Irum and Tariq Khan immigrated from Pakistan in 1986, residing in Willows, California. For 27 years, Irum and Tariq Khan farmed and operated what was then "Khan Family Farms". After Tariq's sudden and tragic death in 2013, Irum took over and became the first female farmer of Pakistani descent in the state of California. Being a mother to three girls, Irum took over, kept farming to provide for her family and then created: Khan and Daughters. With the help of her daughters and employees, Khan & Daughters produces rice feeding millions in the United States and Japan.</p>
